Black Sabbath - Paranoid текст песни

finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
people think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
all day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

can you help me occupy my brain?
oh yeah

i need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
i can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind

make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
happiness I cannot feel and love to me us so unreal

and so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
i tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late
